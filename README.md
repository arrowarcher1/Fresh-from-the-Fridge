# Fresh from the Fridge

## Inspiration
We thought that a common issue people may have is figuring out what to make for food based on the ingredients in a fridge. It can be time-consuming to figure out what a person may know how to make and to make sure they have the sufficient amount of ingredients. This is where our solution comes in, which creates many unique recipes based on data collected from your fridge. 

## What it does
Our solution involves a camera that analyzes the contents of a fridge using video processing, which is then used to itemize the contents of the fridge. Our solution utilizes the ingredients to output recipes that a person can make. 

## How we built it
Our solution involves an OpenMV camera, which incorporates a limit switch for the camera to understand when to start and stop recording the contents within a fridge. The embedded system programming was implemented using Python to create .mp4 files that are stored on Amazon S3 to store the ingredients.
